## CLI timer with Pomodore - Work hard, Play hard

Project made to learn the basic principles of Python. It works as a command line timer and also has the pomodore function. 

If passed only one argument, as minutes, it will start a timer with the given argument in minutes

```
python3 timerloop.py <minutes>

```

If passed two arguments, it will start pomodore, being the first argument the focus time, and the second the resting time
```
python3 timerloop.py <focus minutes> <rest minutes> 
```
